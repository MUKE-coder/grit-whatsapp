// LogSecurityEvent records a security-relevant event to the activity log.

// We piggyback on the existing tamper-evident ActivityLog table — Method
// "SECURITY" + Path = event-constant is the convention. This means every
// security event automatically picks up the hash-chain integrity the
// activity log already provides (a deleted security event breaks the
// chain at verify time), without a separate model to maintain.
//
// Written through the chain, so it is linked and stamped like every other
// entry. It used to be inserted directly with no hash at all: the first event
// broke verification, and the unique index on hash refused every event after.
//
// Database errors are logged but never returned — failing a login or
// logout because the audit log had a hiccup turns audit infrastructure
// into a DoS amplifier. The request itself was usually fine.
