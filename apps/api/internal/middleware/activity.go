//   - safe methods (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS)
//   - non-2xx responses (errors aren't audit-relevant)
//   - unauthenticated requests (no user_id ⇒ nothing to attribute)
//
// The payload digest is a SHA-256 hash of the request body — enough to
// prove "this exact payload was sent" without persisting plain-text
// passwords / secrets / PII. Buffered in memory, so MaxBodySize earlier
// in the chain still bounds it.
//
// Insert is fire-and-forget via a bounded channel + single writer
// goroutine. The single-writer design eliminates lock contention on
// the hash chain — only one goroutine ever appends — and the bounded
// channel caps memory + goroutine count under traffic spikes.
