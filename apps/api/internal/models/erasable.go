// The framework's own tables whose rows exist only to serve a user and carry no
// independent compliance value: hard-deleted when that user is erased.
//
// Resources generated with --owned-by register themselves from their own model
// files, so erasing a user deletes the records they own too. The activity log
// is deliberately absent: its rows hold only a UUID, so anonymizing the user
// anonymizes them, and deleting them would break the audit hash chain.
