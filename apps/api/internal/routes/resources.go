// Mount is what a resource's route file receives: the router groups, already
// built and already carrying their middleware, plus the things a handler needs
// to construct itself.
//
// The groups are the same variables routes.go uses, so a route registered here
// is indistinguishable from one written inline. Public is outside the auth
// middleware and behind an API key; Protected takes a JWT or an API key; Admin
// additionally requires the ADMIN role.

	// Hub is the realtime fan-out hub, for a route that needs to push.
	//
	// It has to be handed over rather than built, because it cannot be built:
	// realtime.NewHub() returns a different registry holding no connections,
	// so a handler that makes its own pushes into nothing and fails silently.
	// There is exactly one live Hub per process and this is it.

// file is all it takes to unmount one. Nothing else in the package refers to
// it by name.
//
// Go runs init() functions in a file-name order fixed by the compiler, so the
// registration order is deterministic. It does not matter in practice: Gin
// routes on a tree, not a list, and prefers a static segment over a parameter
// however the two were added.
