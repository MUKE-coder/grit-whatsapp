// Code generated from Grit's error catalogue. DO NOT EDIT.

// Every error this API returns has a code, and a code always arrives with the
// same status. That second half is the part a frontend needs and the part that
// used to be untrue: VALIDATION_ERROR came back as 422 in some handlers and 400
// in others, so a client had to handle whichever pairing it had happened to see.
//
// The same catalogue generates packages/shared/types/errors.ts, so a TypeScript
// switch over these codes can be exhaustive, and the table at /docs/backend/errors.
